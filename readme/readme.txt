Plugin for CudaText.

Gives dialog "Extract Strings", like in SynWrite. This dialog can find, by regular expression, substrings in the current editor, and then a) Copy them to clipboard, b) Copy them to new tab.

Button "Reg.ex. for e-mail" sets regular expression to find e-mails.

Includes plugin "Filter Lines". Command to find (in current editor tab) all lines, which contain custom (entered in dialog) string, or reg.ex. Found lines are put to a new tab.
