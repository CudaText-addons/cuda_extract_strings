Plugin for CudaText.
Gives dialog "Extract Strings", like in SynWrite.
This dialog can find, by regular expression, substrings in the current editor, and then 
- Copy them to clipboard,
- Copy them to new tab.

Button "Reg.ex. for e-mail" sets regular expression to find e-mails. Ie, it's like plugin "Extract emails" embedded.
